# Prerequisites:
* **A rooted device.**
* **/system partition *being* read-write is best. (This does cover if /system is not read write).**
* **Dm-0 verity and AVB 2.0 must be disabled..**
* **Some good amount of space in /data to store a Linux rootfs**
* **Disable seLinux either through `/proc/cmdline` or by running `setenforce 0`**
* **You should have a backup. Backup for your device's data In case something does go wrong.**

#### A few common questions:
1. **What if I don't have root?**

You can ***root*** your device using **magisk**, **kerneSU**, or other options that let you **root** your device (attempt at your own risk.)

2. **What if I don't have rw system? Or my device somehow doesn't support rw even if dm-0 verity is off?**
First, if you have disabled dm-0 verity (through magisk or in whatever way) try the following command:
```sh
mount -o remount,rw /
mount -o remount,rw /system
```
And try to create a file in /system
```
touch /system/test
```
If it worked you have a fully rw system..

3. **What if /system partition still refuses to be read-write?**
You can actually **not** make /system read-write and skip over this Though i am not sure of how stable it is. It could be more stable than the original method but if you wanna proceed with this. make sure to unlink /etc and you should be good for the most part the README.md does cover how to do this..

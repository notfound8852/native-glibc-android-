### **I fixed my device:**

 I got an **EDL cable** and ye that made it go into EDL mode just fine.. After that was the easy part I looked up some programmer files for my device, found them and fixed my bootloader and reflashed everything else. I will stick to the encrypted version of android since most people use that anyways.. For now ama just get back to figuring out how to get systemd at boot. I just need to test alot. 


Systemd very soon...

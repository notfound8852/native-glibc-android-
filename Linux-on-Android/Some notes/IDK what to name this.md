This was kind of rushed. I had figured this out 4 weeks prior I was working on trying to get systemd on android but unfortunately before i could experiment with that my device that i was using Asus P00J (ZT582KL) broke completely because of a software issue during the flash process.. it unfortunately corrupted the bootloader and pretty much all partitions since i was trying to flash the stock firmware to test early mounting of /data..

Hopefully soon I will either fix my device or buy a new one and try to get systemd working on it.

The reason why this was very rushed was because a on 9th March 25, i saw this article which made me spit out my coffee.

I saw that and I realized that I still hadn't published my work and fearing for the worst I got this out as soon as possible :P First ever post as well.
